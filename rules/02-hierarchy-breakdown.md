# Hierarchy and Breakdown Rules (11-20)

## Rule 11: Epic Limits
Epics are high-level goals limited to 3-5 per project phase.

## Rule 12: Story Format
Stories derive from epics, phrased as "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]."

## Rule 13: Story Task Limits
Limit stories to 5-8 tasks each for manageability.

## Rule 14: Subtask Extraction
Extract 3-7 subtasks per task, each completable in under 4 hours.

## Rule 15: Hierarchy Review
Review hierarchy weekly: Promote subtasks to tasks if oversized.

## Rule 16: Dormant Tagging
Tag inactive project epics with "Dormant" for visibility.

## Rule 17: No Overlapping Hierarchies
No overlapping hierarchies—each repo owns its epic tree.

## Rule 18: Ignition Visualization
Use Ignition tables to visualize epic > story > task > subtask drill-down.

## Rule 19: Active Epic Cap
Cap total active epics at 10 across all repos.

## Rule 20: Acceptance Criteria
Stories must include acceptance criteria before task creation.
